<p><h4>Data, Information, and Systems</h4></p>
<p><h5><u>Data:-</u>
Data can be described as unprocessed facts and figures. Plain collected data as raw facts cannot help in decision making. Data is the raw material that is organized, structured, and interpreted to create useful information systems. 
It is defined as groups of non random symbols in the form of text, images, voice representing quantities action and objects.
</h5></p>
<p><h5><u>Information:-</u></p>
<ul>
<p><li>Information is interpreted data; created from organized structured and processed data in a particular context.</li></p>
<p><li>Data that have meaning within a context</li></p>
<p><li>Data in relationships</li></p>
<p><li>Data after manipulation</li></p>
<p><li>Processed Data</li></p></ul>
Â "Information is a data that has been processed into a form that is meaningful to recipient and is of real or  perceived value in the current or the prospective action or decision of recipient."
</p>
<p>For ex. Reading through data collected from a customer survey with questions in various categories would be time-consuming and not very helpful.
When manipulated, the surveys may provide useful information.
</p></h5>
<p></p><p>
</p><p>

<h4><b>Characteristics of useful information</b></h4><h5><u>Relevant:-</u>Information must pertain to the problem at hand.For example, the total number of years of edcucation may not be relevant to a person's qualifications for a new job.Relevant information might be that the person has so many years of education in mechanical engineering , and so many years of experience. The information must also be presented in a way that helps a person understand it in a specific context.</p><p><u>Complete:-</u>Partial information is often worse than no information. For example, marketing data about household incomes may lead to bad decisions if not accompanied by vital information on the consumption habits of the targeted population.</p><p><u>Accurate:-</u>Erroneous information may lead to disastrous decisions.For example, an inaccurate record of a patient's reaction to penicillin may lead a doctor to harm the patient while believing that she's is helping him.</p><p><u>Current:-</u>Decisions are often based upon the latest information available,but what was a fact yesterday may no longer be one today. For example, a short term investment decision to purchase a stock today based on yesterday's stock prices may be a costly mistake if the stock's price has risen in the interim.</p><p><u>Economical:-</u>In a business setting, the cost of obtaining information must be considered as one cost element involved in any decision. For example, demand for a new product must be researched to reduce risk of marketing failure,but if market research is too expensive,the cost of obtaining the information may diminish profit from sales.</p>
</h5></p><p></p>
	<p><h4>What is a System?</h4></p>
	<h5><p><ul><li><u>System:</u>A set of components that work together to achieve a common goal
 </p></li><p><li><u>Subsystem:</u>One part of a system where the products of more than one system are combined to reach an ultimate goal
</p></li><p><li><u>Closed system:</u>Stand-alone system that has no contact with other systems.</li>
</p><p><li><u>Open system:</u>System that interfaces with other systems.</h5></li>
</p></ul><p></p><h4>Information System</h4><h5><p><ul><li>Information system is a system that gathers data and disseminates information sole purpose of providing information to its users. 
</li></p><p><li>The main object of an information system is to provide information to its users. Information systems vary according to the type of users who use the system.

	<h4>Components of an information system
</h4><p><h5><u>Data:-</u>Input that the system takes to produce information.<p><u>Hardware:-</u>A computer and its peripheral: input , output and storage devices. Hardware also includes data communication equipment.</p><p><u>Software:-</u>Sets of instructions that tell the computer how to take data in, how to process it, how to display information, and how to store data and information.<p><u>Telecommunication:-</u>Hardware and software that facilitate fast transmission and reception of text, picture, sound and animation in the form of electronic data.</p><p><u>People:-</u>Information systems professionals and users who analyze organizational information needs, design and construct information systems, write computer programs, operate the hardware, and maintain software.</p><p><u>Procedures:-</u> Rules for achieving optimal and secure operations in data processing. Procedures include priorities in running different applications on the computer and security measures.</p></h5></p>
	<h4>The Four Stages of Data Processing</h4><h5><ul><p><u><li>Input:</u> Data is collected and entered into computer.</li>
</p><u><li>Data processing:</u> Data is manipulated into information using mathematical, statistical, and other tools.
</li><p><u><li>Output:
</u> Information is displayed or presented.</li></p><p><u><li>Storage: 
</u>Data and information are maintained for later use.</li></p></ul></h5>
<p><h4>Why Study IS?</h4></p>
<p><u><h5>Information Systems Careers</u></p><ul>
<li><p>Systems analyst, specialist in enterprise resource planning (ERP), database administrator, telecommunications specialist, consulting, etc.</p></ul></li>
<p><u>Knowledge Workers</p></u>
<ul><li>Managers and non-managers</li>
<li>Employers seek computer-literate professionals who know how to use information technology.</ul></li>
Computer Literacy Replacing  Traditional Literacy Key to full participation in society.</h5>
<p><h4>Ethical and Societal Issues</h4></p>
<p><u><h5>The Not-So-Bright Side</p></u></h5>
<p><u><h5>Consumer Privacy</p></u>
<ul><li>Organizations collect (and sometimes sell) huge amounts of data on individuals.</ul></li>
<p><u>Employee Privacy</p></u>
<ul><li>IT supports remote monitoring of employees, violating privacy and creating stress.</ul></li>
<p><u>Freedom of Speech</p></u>
<ul><li>IT increases opportunities for pornography, hate speech, intellectual property crime, an d other intrusions; prevention may abridge free speech. </ul></li> 
<p><u>IT  Professionalism</u></p>
<ul><li>No mandatory or enforced code of ethics for IT professionals--unlike other professions.  </ul></li>
<p><u>Social Inequality</p></u>
<ul><li>Less than 20% of the world population have ever used a PC; less than 3% have Internet access. </ul></li> </h5>
<p><h4>Types of information system</h4></p>
<p><h5>An information system is any process that allows individuals and organizations to collect, organize, and interpret data that is relevant to the decision making process of business owners, executives, managers, and general employees. Although an information system does not need to consist of computer hardware and software, the networks that these tools create are the most common types of information systems in use by businesses around the world.</h5></p><h5>
<ul><li><p><b>Transaction Processing Systems (TPS)</li></p></b>
<li><p><b>Management Information Systems (MIS)</li></p></b>

<li><p><b>Decision Support Systems (DSS)</li></p></b>
<li><p><b>Executive Information Systems (EIS)</li></p></b></ul>
<p><b><u>Transaction Processing Systems (TPS):-</b></u>
Transactions represent the core process by which an organization conducts business with the end user of its products or services. Without transactions, a business could not survive because it would have no way to generate the revenue required to remain in operation. The different types of information systems in use today originated from transaction processing systems. When computer hardware and software were starting to be used in business, their primary application was for batch processing that allowed for faster customer transactions and fewer human errors. Many of the old transaction processing systems have been moved online in order to further improve efficiency and convenience.</p></h5><h5>
<p><b><u>Management Information Systems (MIS):-</li></b></u>
As information technology evolved, organizational managers began to discover ways to use information systems to help them manage employees, track business performance, make more informed decisions, and be more efficient with their time. Managers commonly use these types of information systems to monitor daily transactions, characterize product sales in terms of popularity and price, submit orders for additional inventory, and create reports. Management information systems allow managers to maintain a constant awareness of how well the organization is managing its customers, its employees, and its products.</p>
<p><b><u>Decision Support Systems (DSS):-</li></b></u>
These types of information systems are designed to provide additional information that is not found in transaction processing or management information systems. A variety of sources exist that may feed information into the decision support system so that managers are better able to make critical decisions. Sources of information within the organization may include sales, manufacturing statistics, inventory management, and financial reports. External sources of input may include housing costs, material costs, interest rates, and financial market performance.</p></h5>
<p><b><u><h5>Executive Information Systems (EIS):-</li></b></u>
An executive information system is actually a specialized type of decision support mechanism that is designed to inform the decision making process of members of the executive team. Top executives routinely make important high-level strategic decisions that depend heavily on the information that is provided to them by senior managers. The executive information system commonly includes charts, tables, and graphs that have been constructed by the management team using data from other systems.</p></h5>
<h4><p>Knowledge Based Systems</h4></p>
<ul><li><h5>A KBS is a computer program that reasons and uses a knowledge abe to solve complex problems.</li></h5>
<h5><li>A knowledge based system has two types of sub systems : a knowledge base and an inference engine.</li></h5><h5>
<li>KBS focuses on systems that use knowledge based techniques to support human decision making. Learning action it is a computer system that is programmed to imitate human problem solving by means of artificial intelligence and reference to a database of knowledge on a particular subject.</li></ul></h5>

<h4><p><b>Management Information System</h4></p></b>
<p><h5>Is an information system that evaluates , analyzes and processes an organizations data to produce meaningful and useful information based on which the management can take right decision to ensure future growth of the organization.</h5></p>
<h4><p><b>MIS need for Information System</h4></p></b>
<p><h5><ul><li>MIS is the information system that  provides information in the form of standardized reports and display for the manager.</li>
<li>MIS is the broad class of information systems designed to provide information needed for effective decision making. </li>
<li>Data and information created from an accounting information system and the reports generated there on are used to provide accurate, timely and relevant information needed for effective decision making by managers.</li> 
<li>MIS provide information to support management decision making with the following goals</li>
<li>Pre specified and preplanned reporting to managers.</li>
<li>Interactive and ad-hoc support for decision making.</li>
<li>Critical information for top management.</li>
<li>MIS is of vital importance to any organization because it emphasizes on the management decision making not only processing of data generated by business operations.  It emphasizes on the system framework that should be used for organized information system applications.</li> </h5></p>

<p><h4>Classification of IS</p></h4>

<li>OAS</li></ol>
<p><h5>Management Support System</h5>
<ol type="i"><li>MIS</li>
<li>DSS</li>
<li>EIS</li></p></ol>
<h4><p>Office Automation System</h4></p>
<h5><ul><li>The word automation refers to a method of using a wide range of computer and machine aided tasks to help improve productivity and create easier ways to do business.</li> 
<li>Different types of automation are commonly used in different types of industries.</li>
<li>Office automation refers to the varied computer machinery and software used to digitally create, collect, store, manipulate and relay office information needed for accomplishing basic tasks.</li>
<li>Raw data , storage, electronic transfer and the management of electronic business information comprise the basic activities of an office automation system. Office automation helps in optimizing or automating existing office procedures.</li>
<li>OAS are configurations of networked computer hardware and software.</li> 
<li>A variety of OAS are now applied to business and communication functions that used to be performed manually or in multiple location of a organization, such as preparing written communications and strategic planning.</li>
<li>In addition functions that once required coordinating the expertise of outside specialists in typesetting, printing or electronic recording can now be integrated into everyday work of and organization saving both time and money.</li></h5></ul>

<h4><p><b>Types of functions integrated by OAS</h4></p></b>
<h5><ul><li>Electronic publishing</li>
<li>Electronic communication</li>
<li>Electronic collaboration</li>
<li>Image processing</li>
