	<p><b><h4>Planning</h4></b></p>
<h5><ul><li>Planning is deciding what to do before you do it.</li>
<li>In MIS, the information is recognized as a major resource like
capital and time. If this resource has to be managed well, it calls
upon the management to plan for it and control it, so that the
information becomes a vital resource for the system.</li>
<li>The management information system needs good planning.</li>
<li>This system should deal with the management information not
with data processing alone.</li>
<li>It should provide support for the management planning, decisionmaking
and action.</li>
<li>It should provide support to the changing needs of business
management.</h5></li></ul>
<p><b><h4>Planning for MIS</h4></b></p>
<h5><b>MIS design and development process has to address the following issues successfully:</b>
<ul><li>There should be effective communication between the developers and users of the system.</li>
<li>There should be synchronization in understanding of management, processes and IT among the users
as well as the developers.</li>
<li>Understanding of the information needs of managers from different functional areas and combining
these needs into a single integrated system.</li>
<li>Creating a unified MIS covering the entire organization will lead to a more economical, faster and
more integrated system, however it will increase in design complexity manifold.</li>
<li>The MIS has to be interacting with the complex environment comprising all other sub-systems in the
overall information system of the organization. So, it is extremely necessary to understand and
define the requirements of MIS in the context of the organization.</li>
<li>It should keep pace with changes in environment, changing demands of the customers and growing
competition.</li>
<li>It should utilize fast developing in IT capabilities in the best possible ways.</li>
<li>Cost and time of installing such advanced IT-based systems is high, so there should not be a need
for frequent and major modifications.</li>
<li>It should take care of not only the users i.e., the managers but also other stakeholders like
employees, customers and suppliers.</li>
<li>Once the organizational planning stage is over, the designer of the system should take
the following strategic decisions for the achievement of MIS goals and objectives:</li>
<li>Development Strategy: Example - an online, real-time batch.</li>
<li>System Development Strategy: Designer selects an approach to system development like
operational verses functional, accounting verses analysis.</li>
<li>Resources for the Development: Designer has to select resources. Resources can be inhouse
verses external, customized or use of package.</li>
<li>Manpower Composition: The staffs should have analysts, and programmers.</h5></li></ul>
<p><h4><b>Information planning.</b></p></h4>
<h5><b>Information system planning essentially involves:</b>
<ul><li>Identification of the stage of information system in the organization.</li>
<li>Identification of the application of organizational IS.</li>
<li>Evolution of each of this application based on the established evolution criteria.</li>
<li>Establishing a priority ranking for these applications.</li>
<li>Determining the optimum architecture of IS for serving the top priority applications.</h5></li></ul>

<h4><p><b>Information needs of an organization</h4></p></b>
<h5><b><u><p>Three methodologies can be adopted to determine the requirements in developing a management information
system for any organization:</b></p></u>
<b>(I)Business Systems Planning (BSP) -</b><ul><li>This methodology is developed by IBM.</li>
<li>It identifies the IS priorities of the organization and focuses on the way data is maintained in the system.</li>
<li>It uses data architecture supporting multiple applications.</li>
<li>It defines data classes using different matrices to establish relationships among the organization, its
processes and data requirements.</li></ul>
<b>(II) Critical Success Factor (CSF) -</b><ul><li>This methodology is developed by John Rockart of MIT.</li>
<li>It identifies the key business goals and strategies of each manager as well as that of the business.</li>
<li>Next, it looks for the critical success factors underlying these goals.</li>
<li>Measure of CSF effectiveness becomes an input for defining the information system requirements.</li></ul>
<b>(III) End/Means (E/M) analysis -</b><ul><li>This methodology is developed by Wetherbe and Davis at the University of Minnesota.</li>
<li>It determines the effectiveness criteria for outputs and efficiency criteria for the processes generating the outputs.</li>
<li>At first it identifies the outputs or services provided by the business processes.</li>
<li>Then it describes the factors that make these outputs effective for the user.</li>
<li>Finally it selects the information needed to evaluate the effectiveness of outputs.</h5></li></ul>
<h4><p><b>Organizational planning process</h4></p></b>
<h5><li>Evaluating what they have accomplished and what they have acquired</li>
<li>Analyzing their environment.</li>
<li>Anticipating future developments.</li>
<li>Deciding on what goals they want to achieve.</li>
<li>Deciding what actions to take to achieve their goals.</h5></li></ul>

<h4><p><b>Planning Process</h4></p></b>

<h4><p><b>Steps of Information system planning</h4></p></b>
<href= isp>

<p><h5><b>Mission:</b>Reason for being -it is a statement of the basic purpose or purposes for which the organization exists. eg. "to supply the energy to the consumer"</h5></p>
<p><b><h5>Goals:</b>General statement of what is to be accomplished. eg."reduce time to respond to service request without increasing number of service personnel"</h5></p>
<p><b><h5>Strategies:</b>General approaches to achieving goals. eg."becoming low cost producer in its industry"</h5></p>
<p><b><h5>Objectives:</b>Statement of measurable results to be achieved. eg."specific increases in earning per share"</p></h5>
<p><b><h5>Tactics:</b>More specific guides to actions that would implement strategies. eg."increasing investment in automation"</p></h5>
<p><b><h5>Policy:</b>General guidelines that direct & constrain decision making within a organization. eg."promoting from within"</p></h5>
<p><b><h5>Rules & Procedures:</b>More specific statements that direct decision making. eg."hiring employees,rules protecting employees jobs."</p></h5>

<h4><p><b>Role of top management in IS planning</h4></p></b>
<h5><ul><li>Recognize IT as an indispensible resource.</li>
<li>Understand that IT is a complex resource.</li>
<li>Regard IT as owned by the entire organization.</li>
<li>Regard ISs as a source for gaining strategic goals.</li>
<li>View ISs as a tool to control power</h5></li></ul>

<h4><p><b>Information Architecture</h4></p></b>
<h5><ul><li>IA provides a blue print for IT infrastructure in an organization.</li> 
<li>It integrates business strategy and IS strategy</li>
<li>What, When, Where, and How </h5></li></ul>


<h4><p><b>Information Architecture</h4></p></b>
<h5><b>IA is develop to meet the following requirements:</b>
	<li>Support the information flows.</li>
	<li>Facilitate communication between people.</li>
	<li>Enable management to rethink business strategies.</h5></li></ul>

<h4><p><b>Weaknesses of BSP Method</h4></p></b>
<h5><ul><li>BSP requires a firm commitment from the top management and their substantial involvement.</li>
<li>It requires high degree of IT experience within the BSP planning team.</li>
<li>There is a problem of bridging the gap between top down planning and bottom up implementation.</li>
<li>It does not incorporate a software design methodology</li>
<li>It is time consumable methods and effort required for its successful implementation.</h5></li></ul>

CSF (John Rockert)

<h4><p><b>Weaknesses of CSF method</h4></p></b>
<h5><ul><li>It does not define information architecture.</li>
<li>CSFs partly reflect a particular executives management styles.</li>
<li>There is more potential errors in the process of extracting individual CSFs and combining them into a common set of critical factors for organizational success.</h5></li></ul>
