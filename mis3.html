    <h5><p><b>FEATURES & STRUCTURES OF MIS :- </b>Features of MIS, Elements of MIS,Requirements for a successful MIS, Limitations of MIS,Structures of MIS.<br>
<b>LEVELS OF MIS AND MANAGEMENT SYSTEM FOR DECISION MAKING :- </b>Levels of MIS,Planning, Forecasting, Control, modeling, computing, database administration. MIS in context of decision Making: Programmed and Non-Programmed decision.</p></h5></div>

<h4><p><b>Features of MIS</h4></b></p>
<h5><ul><li>It should be based on a long term planning.</li>
<li>It should provide a holistic view of the dynamics and structure of the organization.</li>
<li>It should work as a complete and comprehensive system covering all interconnecting sub-systems within the organization.</li> 
<li>It should be planned in a top-down way, as the decision makers of the management should actively take part ad provide clear direction at the development stage of the MIS.</li>
<li>It should be based on need of strategic, operational, and tactical information of managers of an organization.</li>
<li>It should also take care of exceptional situations by reporting such situations.</li> 
<li>It should be able to make forecasts and estimates and generate advanced information, thus providing a competitive advantage. Decision makers an take actions on the basis of such predictions.</li>
<li>It should create linkage between all sub-systems within the organization, so that the decision makers can take the right decision based on an integrated view.</li>
<li>It should allow easy flow of information through various sub-systems, thus avoiding redundancy and duplicity of data. It should simplify the operations with as much practicability as possible.</li>
<li>Although the MIS is integrated, complete system, it should be made in such a flexible way that it could be easily split into smaller sub-systems as and when required.</li> 
<li>A central database is the backbone of a well-built MIS.</h5></li></ul>

<h4><p><b>Characteristics of Computerized MIS</h4></p></b>
<h5><ul><li>It should be able to process data accurately and high speed using various techniques like operations research, simulation, heuristics etc.</li>
<li>It should be able to collect, organize, manipulate and update large amount of raw data of both related and unrelated nature, coming from various internal and external sources at different periods of time.</li>
<li>It should provide real time information on ongoing events without any delay.</li>
<li>It should support various output formats and follow latest rules and regulations in practice.</li> 
<li>It should provide organized and relevant information for all levels of management : strategic, operational, and tactical.</li>
<li>It should aim at extreme flexibility in data storage and retrieval.</h5></li></ul>
<p><h4><b>Requirements for a successful MIS</b></h4></p>
<ul><li><h5>Mis is interacted with term globalization so that it should be prepared with lattest technology.</li>
<li>Mis is easy to operate.</li>
<li>Mis design provide basic capability for user to deal with complex situation.</li>
<li>The mis concentrate on the development the information support to manage critical success factors in organizations.</li>
<li>Mis concentrates on the mission critical applications serving the need of the top management.</ul></li></h5>
<p><h4><b>Features of Contributing Failure of mis</b></h4></p>
<ul><li><h5>The mis is conceived as a data processing and not an information processing system.</h5></li>
<li><h5>Mis is not those information that manager needs instead of it provide those information that function calls.</h5></li>
<li><h5>Mis is not provide proper way to deal with system complexity instead of it recognized its successful implementation.</h5></li>
<li><h5>Mis is not concentrate on system control and its neglect basic system tools which are input, process and output.</h5></li>
<li><h5>The mis is developed without streamlining the BPS in organization.</h5></li>
<li><h5>Mis is not concentrate towards the training aspects of users.</h5></li>
<li><h5>The mis does not meet certain critical and key factors of the users such as a response to the query on database.</h5></li>
<li><h5>Mis is not fully guaranteed that it will provide complete problem solving mechanism in the organization.</h5></li>
<li><h5>Sometimes lack of capability of developers makes mis an unused product in organization.</h5></li>
<li><h5>The mis does not give perfect information to all the users in the organization.</h5></li>
<li><h5>Mis is assumption of developer so sometime this assuming becomes reason for failures.</li></ul></h5>
<p><h4><b>Prerequisite for successful MIS</b></h4></p>
<h5><ul><li>Qualified system and management personnel</li>
<li>Database</li>
<li>Support of top management</li>
<li>Control and maintenance of MIS</li>
<li>Evaluation of MIS</h5></li></ul>

<p><h4><b>Qualified System & Management Personnel</b></h4></p>
<h5>One of the pre-requisites of successful MIS is that well qualified personnel should man it. The personnel should comprised of atleast two categories:
<ul><li>(i) Systems, communications and computer experts - They should be capable of management concepts. Well versed in decisionmaking , planning and control functions.</li>
<li>(ii) Management experts - They should understand the conceptsand operations of computers. This will help in hiring the suitableexperts.</li>
<li>(iii) System Users- They should also have application knowledgeof computers.</li></ul></h5>


<p><h4><b>Database</b></h4></p>
<h5>Database is a consolidation of many files organised in such away that access to data is improved and data redundancy isreduced.The important features of databases are :
<ul><li>(I) Avoiding data redundancy and inconsistency</li>
<li>(ii) Program Data Independence</li>
<li>(iii) Flexible Access to Shared data</li>
<li>(iv) Reliability - Relationships between entities may bedefined easily</li>
<li>(v) centralized Control of Data -- Global planning & evolutionof data resources, Maintenance of data security, Integrityconstraints, & enforce standards whiles naming data.</li></h5></ul>

<p><h4><b>Support of Top Management</b></h4></p>
<h5><p>To be effective, the MIS should get full support from the top management. Reason is that CBIS are large and growing larger and larger in the context to the growing technological change.</h5></p>
<p><h4><b>Control and Maintenance of MIS</b></h4></p>
<h5><p>Control means to check whether the operations are as intended. Sometimes the users developed their own methods to use the system which cuts effectiveness. To check them control systems are required. Maintenance is closely related to control. During the maintenance process, the management will discover needs for improvement of the system.</h5></p>

<p><h4><b>Evaluation of MIS</b></h4></p>

<h5><li>The evaluation of MIS should take into account the following:-- Flexibility in-built, to meet any expected or unexpected information requirement in future-- Ascertaining the views of the users and the designers about the capabilities and deficiencies of the system-- Guiding the appropriate authority about the steps to be taken to keep the effectiveness of the MIS alive.</li>
<li>Highly sensitive and requires constant monitoring</li>
<li>Budgeting of Budgeting extremely difficult</li>
<li>Lack of flexibility to update itself</li>
<li>Lots of time required to construct or prepare MIS</li>
<li>Constant training required.</li>
<li>In depth study or required training has to be carried out before designing the software. Organizational change: Difficult to adapt in new settings for Human resource i.e. Employees.</li>
<li>Quality and reliability of the available information.</li>
<li>The expense to create and implement an MIS,</li>
<li>Training time for employees,</li>
<li>Capturing wrong or incomplete information. Sometimes when the information is wrong, it create chaos in organization</h5></li>


<p><h4><b>Physical Components</p></h4></b>
<h5><ul><li><b>Hardware:</b> E.g. CPU, Monitor, Keyboard, Printer etc.</li>
<li><b>Software:</b> E.g. System and Application S/W.</li>
<li><b>Database:</b> E.g. Data stored in files.</li>
<li><b>Procedures:</b> E.g. Manuals etc.</li>
<li><b>Operating Personnel:</b> E.g. Computer Operators, Programmers, System Analysts, System Manager etc.</li>
<li><b>Input & Output:</b> E.g. Printouts, Reports etc.</li></h5></ul>

<p><h4><b>Processing Functions</p></h4></b>
<h5><ul><li><b>To Process Transactions:</b>E.g. Making a purchase or a sale of a product.</li>
<li><b>To Maintain Master Files:</b> E.g. For preparing an employees salary, required data items are Basic Pay, Allowances, Deductions etc.</li>
<li><b>To Produce Reports:</b> For e.g. Specific or Adhoc reports</li>
<li><b>To Process Enquiries:</b> For e.g. Regular or Adhoc enquiry.</li>
<li><b>To Process interactive Support Applications:</b> E.g. Applications designed for planning, analysis and decision making.</h5></li>

<p><h4><b>Output For Users</p></h4></b>
<ul><h5><li>Transaction Documents or Screens</li>
<li>Preplanned Reports</li>
<li>Preplanned Inquiry Responses</li>
<li>Adhoc Reports & Inquiry Responses</li>
<li>User-machine Dialog Results</ul></h5></li>

<p><h4><b>Decision Making</p></h4></b>
<p><h4>Structured / Programmable Decisions:</p></h4>
<ul><h5><li>Decisions that are repetitive, routine and have a definite procedure for handling them.</li>
<li>For e.g. Inventory reorder formula, Rules for granting Credit.</h5></li></ul>
<p><h4>Unstructured / Non-Programmable Decisions:</p></h4>
<ul><h5><li>Non-routine decision in which the decision maker must provide judgment, evaluation, and insights into the problem definition.</ul></h5></li>
<p><h4> Semi-Structured Decisions:</p></h4>
<ul><h5><li>Decision where only part of the problem has a clear cut answer provided by an accepted procedure.</ul></h5></li>

<h4><li><p><b>Programmed and non-programmed decision</h4></li></b></p>
<ol><h4><p><li>Programmed decisions are basically automated processes, general routine work where :</h4></li></p>
<ul><li><h5>These decisions have been taken several times.</li></h5>
<li><h5>These decisions follow some guidelines or rules.</li></h5>
<li><h5>For example, selecting a reorder level for inventories is a programmed decision.</li></ul></h5>
<h4><li><p>Non programmed decisions occur in unusual and non-addressed situations so:</li></ol></h4></p>
<ul><li><h5>It would be a new decision.</li></h5>
<li><h5>There will not be any rules to follow.</li></h5>
<li><h5>These decisions are made based on the available information.</li></h5>
<li><h5>These decisions are based on the managers' discretion (choice) ,instinct, perception and judgment.</li></h5>
<li><h5>For example, investing in a new technology is a non-programmed decision.</li></ul></h5>
